/**
 * @details For a given UTC date, calculate delta(AT) = TAI-UTC. This function

 *    <b>IMPORTANT</b>
 * <hr>
 *        A new version of this function must be
 *        produced whenever a new leap second is
 *        announced.  There are four items to
 *        change on each such occasion:
 *        -# A new line must be added to the set
 *           of statements that initialize the
 *           array "changes".
 *        -# The constant IYV must be set to the
 *           current year.
 *        -# The "Latest leap second" comment
 *           below must be set to the new leap
 *           second date.
 *        -# The "This revision" comment, later,
 *           must be set to the current date.
 *        .
 *        Change (2) must also be carried out
 *        whenever the function is re-issued,
 *        even if no leap seconds have been
 *        added.<br>

 * ------------- | -------------
 * +1            | Dubious year (Note 1)
 *  0            | OK
 * -1            | Bad year
 * -2            | Bad month
 * -3            | Bad day (Note 3)
 * -4            | Bad fraction (Note 4)
 *
 * @note
 * -# UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
 *    to call the function with an earlier date.  If this is attempted,
 *    zero is returned together with a warning status.
 *    Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
 *    advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
 *    impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
 *    after the release year of the present function (see the constant
 *    IYV) is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is
 *    returned but the result is computed in the normal way.
 *    For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is +1.
 *    This is distinct from the error status -1, which signifies a year
 *    so early that JD could not be computed.
 * -# If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
 *    the UTC-TAI value returned is for the period leading up to the
 *    leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
 *    second ends, the UTC-TAI returned is for the period following the
 *    leap second.
 * -# The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
 *    1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
 *    such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
 *    function, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.
 * -# The fraction of day is used only for dates before the
 *    introduction of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the
 *    end of 1971.  It is tested for validity (0 to 1 is the valid
 *    range) even if not used;  if invalid, zero is used and status -4
 *    is returned.  For many applications, setting fd to zero is
 *    acceptable;  the resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and
 *    occurs only pre-1972).
 * -# The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
 *    errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
 *    month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, status -2 (bad month)
 *    will be returned.
 * -# In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.
 *
 * \b Reference: <br>
 * - For dates from 1961 January 1 onwards, the expressions from the
 *    file ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat are used.
 * - The 5ms timestep at 1961 January 1 is taken from 2.58.1 (p87) of \cite esaa .
