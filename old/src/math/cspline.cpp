 * -# The returned array (y2) is y2[1...n]
 * -# The memory for the y2 array,must be already allocated (size n)
 * -# It is important that the program spline is called only once to
 *    process an entire tabulated function in arrays x[i] and y[i].
 *    Once this has been done, values of the interpolated function for
 *    any value of x are obtained by calls (as many as desired) to a
 *    separate routine csplineint (for "spline interpolation")
 * -# For a unique solution, we need to specify two further conditions, typically
 *    taken as boundary conditions at x(1) and x(N). The most common ways of
 *    doing this are either:
 *     - set one or both of the second derivatives at y(1) and y(N) equal to zero,
 *       giving the so-called natural cubic spline, which has zero second 
 *       derivative on one or both of its boundaries, or
 *     - set either of y(1) and y(N) to values calculated from equation for first 
 *       derivative so as to make the first derivative of the interpolating function
 *       have a specified value on either or both boundaries.
